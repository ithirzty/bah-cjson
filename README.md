# C-JSON
It's a [Bah](https://github.com/ithirzty/bah) library used for serializing/deserializing JSON objects.

This will lazy load them, it will not load all the file in memory but rather a single JSON object at a time.

## To do
- [x] Working prototype.
- [ ] Thread safe version.
- [ ] Updating an element.
- [ ] Search functions (by function pointer).
- [ ] Optimizations?
